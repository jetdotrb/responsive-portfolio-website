# responsive-portfolio-website-v1

#### A simple but beautiful responsive portfolio website for Designers/Developers!

Hi everyone! I wrote this responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap v5, and JavaScript. The UI layout design is not mine, I just found it on Figma community and used it as a mock up. The UI designer is Tinjo Thomas, he uploaded the layout on Figma as an open source and can be use for any work.
