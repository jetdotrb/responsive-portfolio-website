# responsive-portfolio-website

#### A simple but beautiful responsive portfolio website for Designers/Developers!

Hello, everyone! I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap v5 to create this responsive portfolio website. The UI layout design is not my own, I found it on Figma community and used it as a mockup. Tinjo Thomas is the UI designer, and he shared the layout on Figma as an open source that can be used for any work.
